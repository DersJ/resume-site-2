      <h3>About Anders</h3>
      <h5>Senior Cloud Services Engineer at Teradata</h5>
      <p>
        I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May
        of 2020 with a BS in Computer Science. As a problem solver since birth,
        I love using my programming and engineering skills to engineer solutions
        to real world problems.

        Engineer working on the Cloud User Experience team. I build the UIs
        (Angular) and APIs (GraphQL) that comprise Vantage Console, an analytics
        & operations platform for Teradata cloud systems. Vantage Console
        integrates with all 3 major cloud providers to provide administors a
        single pane of glass interface to manage their deployments. As our team
        name implies, we are responsible for creating and maintaining an excellent
        user experience for a wide variety of personas.
