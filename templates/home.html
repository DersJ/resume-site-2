<h3> About Anders </h3>
<h5> Software Engineer at Teradata</h5>
<p> I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May of 2020 with a BS in Computer Science. As a problem solver since birth, I love using my programming and engineering skills to create applicable solutions to real world problems. Outside of CS, I'm an avid Ultimate Frisbee Player (National Champion in 2015, 2016 and 2018 and captain of the UNC Men's Ultimate team, Darkside). I spend my free time exploring music and photography. </p>
<p>In May of 2019 I started as an software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.teradata.com/" target="_blank">Teradata</a> as part of the Analytic Applications team based in Raleigh, NC, and I was brought on as a full time engineer after graduation. I work on applications which make up the Vantage Customer Experience and Vantage Analyst product lines. My responsibilities include participating in an agile software team, implementing new features, fixing bugs and presenting at bi-weekly sprint demos.
