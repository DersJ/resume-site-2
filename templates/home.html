<h3> About me </h3>
<p> I'm a member of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill class of 2020, working toward a BS in Computer Science with a minor in entrepreneurship. As a problem solver since birth, I love using my programming and engineering skills to create applicable solutions to real world problems. Outside of CS, I'm an avid Ultimate Frisbee Player (National Champion in 2015, 2016 and 2018), and this year I was elected to be captain of the UNC Men's Ultimate team, Darkside. I spend my free time exploring music, hiking, and photography. </p>
<p>This summer I embarked on a cross-country road trip with a few friends. We backpacked and camped all over western Canada and the U.S. Check out my <a href='/blog/'>blog</a> and <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/dersj/'>Flickr</a> for updates and pictures!</p>
