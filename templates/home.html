<h3> About Anders </h3>
<h5> UI Engineering Intern at Teradata</h5>
<p> I'm a member of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill class of 2020, working toward a BS in Computer Science. As a problem solver since birth, I love using my programming and engineering skills to create applicable solutions to real world problems. Outside of CS, I'm an avid Ultimate Frisbee Player (National Champion in 2015, 2016 and 2018 and captain of the UNC Men's Ultimate team, Darkside). I spend my free time exploring music, hiking, and photography. </p>
<p>In May of 2019 I started my current internship at <a href="https://www.teradata.com/" target="_blank">Teradata</a> as part of the Analytic Applications team based in Raleigh, NC. I work on applications which make up the Vantage Customer Experience and Vantage Analyst product lines (both of which are featured on the Teradata Homepage). My responsibilities include participating in an agile software team, implementing new features, fixing bugs and presenting at bi-weekly sprint demos.
